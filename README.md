## What is it?

Weekflow is a web application designed to help you organize your week. You can create your appointments with the desired time, the desired color and a description. Of course you can also edit the appointments if there is a time shift or something important needs to be added to the description. You can also remove the appointments if the appointment was canceled or the appointment was completed. There is a backend that stores the data, i.e. the appointments, so that there is the best possible user experience.

## Plans in the future:

In the future, I plan on upgrading the application so that incorrect user inputs can be handled. The app is therefore not yet 100% finished, but I wanted to publish the project already.

## Pictures of the app:
